<h1>Why Travel?</h1>
<p>For thousands of years humanity has conquered distant lands; charting new course into the unknown. Curiosity is what drives the human spirit to explore new places, learning new cultures, eating new cuisines/foods from different places, volunteering, contributing, teaching, and my more things.</p>
<h2>Travel tips</h2>
<p>When it comes to traveling, their is always the issue of money. Here are some tips of how to start your Adventure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open a second checking/savings account at the bank; and designate this account for traveling. Or find a piggy bank, large jar or metal box to put your money away.</li>
  <li>If you get paid every week, take a minimum of $50 and put it way for your trip. </li>
  <li>If you get paid bi-weekly, take a minimum of $100 and put it way for your trip.</li>
  <li>I recommend getting a second job that isn't to stressful. In that case you can use the money you earn from that second job for a trip</li>
  <li>If you're a teacher or a staff member at Elementary or High School; you're in luck because you have the same schedule as your students. Meaning you will have holidays and vacations off.</li>
  <li>Cut down on unecessary bills to earn your money for ex.: Netflix, Hulu, gym merbership, etc. </li>
  <li>Cut down on unecessary spending.</li>
  <li>If you have a career, job, responsibilities, etc.; I recommend to plan your trip for a minimum of 3-5 days.</li>
  <li>Plan your trip 4-6 months ahead</li>
  <li>Do reasearch online or ask questions to people that have been to the destination you plan to go.</li>
  <li>To book a flight, always book your flight on Tuesday. Between 12-3pm for cheaps prices.</li>
  <li>Never book a flight to depart on a Monday(beginning of the business week), Thursday and Friday(normally when people trend to start their weekend) and Sunday(it's the end of the week and people decide to return the day before they have to go to work).</li>
  <li>Always book your flight to depart on Tuesday and Wednesday(cheapest day to flyout), Friday(sometimes) and Saturday is cheap to leave because its already the weekend.</li>
  <li>For booking arrival flights back home the best days to return is Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday.</li>
  Never book a flight with cheap airlines line Spirit, Frontier, or any other 1 star rated airline.(Unless your super tight on a budget then that's on you.)
  <li>To book somewhere to crash or stay for your trip, I recommend AirBnB if you want to stay somewhere nice and cozy(avg. price $40-$65 per night). But if you're on a tight budget I recommend a hostel (avg. price $10-$45 per night). Another recommendation is couchsurfing(it's free), I provide a website in the resources link to sign up for more information.</li>
  <li>Plan accordingly when it comes to transportation and tourist areas. Make sure you know how far away is a particular tourist are or what time a bus or train or flight schedule to leave for the next destination.</li>
  <li>DOWNLOAD GOOGLE MAPS(IT'S A LIFE SAVER!!!)</li>
  <li>Plan accordingly to where you're traveling for ex.: if you're going to Iceland in the Winter don't take shorts, take warm clothing or vice versa. </li>
  <li>Backpack traveling is the way to go.</li>
  <li>Invest on a good 35-55L backpack(don't drag or carry luggage around).</li>
  <li>Don't over pack, meaning don't take more than what you need. Take what is essential like certain amount of socks and underwear, toothbrush, toothpaste, a couple of shirts, 2-3 pair of shorts(that includes swimming trunks or shorts, etc.), 1-2 pair jeans, a pair of sandles or TOMS, pair of hiking shoes(also if you plan to out for the night life wherever you go then I recommend a good pair of shoes to look good), small aid kit, water bottle, electronic chargers for electronics, portable battery w/ built on solar panel for emergency, grooming or personal hygiene products like shampoo and soap(A MUST!!!).</li>
  <li>If you're alergic or get sick easily, you must go see your primary care physician or doctor to give you travel shots for certain pathogens or diseases.</li>
  <li>I recommend to sign up for travel insurance.</li>
  <li>Make sure to research ahead of time when it comes to transportation.</li>
  <li>If you're willing to spend money on packages, that's on your own discreation. I don't recommend buy packages to travel because their expensive. With a little bit of research and patience you can book all of the items that a package was offering but for cheaper.</li>
